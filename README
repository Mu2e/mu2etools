This package provides the generate_fcl script.  It depends on the
mu2ebintools package, and requires an appropriate FHICL_FILE_PATH to
be set (which is usually accomplished by setting up Mu2e Offline).
Because of those dependencies the script lives in a separate package
and not in e.g. mu2efiletools.

Source Offline/setup.sh, or export MU2E_UPS_QUALIFIERS by hand prior
to "setup mu2etools".

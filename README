In addition to the scripts in the bin subdirectory, the mu2etools
package also contains logic to deal with various versions of the FHICL
library and provides a fhicl-get wrapper to shadow the identically
named executable when needed.  This functionality is used by
mu2eprodsys in the mu2egrid package.

Before running mu2etools scripts one need to setup the fhiclcpp
package and FHICL_FILE_PATH environment variable.  This is usually
accomplished by setting up Mu2e Offline.
